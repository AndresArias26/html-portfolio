<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>
    This is my favorite movie, because I fall in love with Marvel Universe.<br /> 
    Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.<br />
    Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturer Stark Industries.
    When Stark is captured in a war zone and sustains a serious heart wound, he builds his iconic Iron Man armor out of scrap and escapes his captors.

<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>This movie made me love the cars in general and also you can see a lot of action and special effects.</p>

<h3>Batman</h3>
<p>When I watch this movide I was 12 years old, I was fascinated to see a millionaire save the city.</p>
